I'm sick of being asked for feedback.

This is a [Sieve](https://proton.me/support/sieve-advanced-custom-filters)
filter which can be used to get rid of emails that ask for it. The filter is
imperfect and incomplete. Desperate attempts to _know what you think_ will still
get through, and there may be some false positives. However, the filter will
also be improved over time.

You may need to create a folder named _Filtered out_ before this filter will
work.
